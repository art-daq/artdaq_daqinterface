# JCF, 10/1/14
# I cut-and-pasted this from
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11130156/suppress-stdout-stderr-print-from-python-functions,
# as a tool to suppress unwanted output from compiled functions called
# within Python code (here, specifically, I'm referring to artdaq
# diagnostic output sent to stdout)
# Define a context manager to suppress stdout and stderr.

# deepsuppression's constructor now expects a boolean; deepsupression
# will simply be a no-op (i.e., the output it's meant to suppress will
# still go to stdout) only if the boolean is True. This makes it
# possible to control deepsuppression via DAQInterface's verbosity
# levels

    A context manager for doing a "deep suppression" of stdout and stderr in
    Python, i.e. will suppress all print, even if the print originates in a
    compiled C/Fortran sub-function.
       This will not suppress raised exceptions, since exceptions are printed
    to stderr just before a script exits, and after the context manager has
    exited (at least, I think that is why it lets exceptions through).
